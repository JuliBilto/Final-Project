  <h1>What Not to Wear to an Internship </h1>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
  <h2><strong>Super Loud Pieces</strong></h2>
  <h3><br />
  Start with a basic black dress or a pants-and-blazer combo— what<a href="http://internqueen.com/" title="Intern Queen"><strong>Berger</strong></a>&nbsp;calls a &ldquo;blank canvas&rdquo; outfit. With simple, minimalist pieces, you&rsquo;re free to have a little fun with your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seventeen.com/fashion/tips/cute-accessories-for-fall" title="Cute Accessories To Rock This Fall"><strong>accessories</strong></a>. Show off your personality with statement necklaces or a colorful shoe. We love Berger&rsquo;s perfect black dress here!</h3>
  <h2><br />
  <strong>Flashy Clothing</strong></h2>
  <h3><br />
  Stay away from loud or flashy clothing at your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seventeen.com/college/fall-internships" title="Do You Need A Fall Internship?"><strong>internship</strong></a>. &ldquo;You want them to remember you because you were reliable, loyal, professional, and hardworking—not because you had on a bedazzled blazer,&rdquo; Berger says. You can absolutely show your personal style, but remember your&nbsp;<a href="http://internqueen.com/" title="Intern Queen"><strong>internship</strong></a>&nbsp;<em>isn&rsquo;t</em>&nbsp;a fashion show.</h3>
  <h2><br />
    <strong>Party Attire</strong></h2>
  <h3><br />
    Anything that you would even&nbsp;<em>think</em>&nbsp;of wearing to a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seventeen.com/fun/articles/throw-a-vma-viewing-party" title="Throw A VMA Viewing Party!"><strong>party</strong></a>&nbsp;or club is out. Just don&rsquo;t go there! Huge no-no&rsquo;s according to&nbsp;<a href="http://internqueen.com/" title="Intern Queen"><strong>Berger</strong></a>? Tiny tops,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seventeen.com/fashion/tips/17-ways-to-wear-cut-outs" title="17 Ways To Wear Cut-Outs"><strong>cut-out</strong></a>&nbsp;dresses, crop tops, smokey eyes, and super sexy pumps.&nbsp;Save them for the weekend!<br />
    <strong>Tight Clothes</strong><br />
  &ldquo;If you look like you&rsquo;re dressing up for Halloween as a &lsquo;naughty secretary&rsquo; or &lsquo;schoolgirl,&rsquo; you're wearing the wrong attire,&rdquo;&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/InternQueen" title="Lauren Berger Twitter"><strong>Berger</strong></a>warns. Button-down shirts shouldn&rsquo;t be too tight or show cleavage, skirts shouldn&rsquo;t be too tight or short, and makeup should be simple. Save the sexy look for October 31st!</h3>
  <h2><br />
    <strong>Unprofessional Shoes</strong></h2>
  <h3><br />
    While you may be able to rock flats everyday once you actually secure the internship, Berger says to go with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seventeen.com/fashion/blog/shoesday-tuesday/sole-society-fall-shoes" title="Cute Shoes For Back-To-School"><strong>heels</strong></a>&nbsp;for your interview—a basic black pump is always in style. Heels look professional, sophisticated, and put-together. But, save your soles! Especially if you live in a city, bring&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seventeen.com/college/advice/cute-comfortable-flats#slide-1" title="Fall's Flirtiest Flats"><strong>flats</strong></a>&nbsp;to walk to and from your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seventeen.com/college/college-interview-tips" title="17 Dos and Don'ts For Your College Interview"><strong>interview</strong></a>&nbsp;in.</h3>
  <h2><br />
    <strong>Crazy Hairstyles</strong></h2>
  <h3><br />
    For interviews, keep your&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/hair-ideas/" title="Seventeen Hair Inspiration"><strong>hair</strong></a>&nbsp;simple. Try styles like a topknot or a high pony! Skip wacky styles—you want people to notice&nbsp;<em>you</em>, not your unusual &lsquo;do. &ldquo;I like simple hair for&nbsp;<a href="http://internqueen.com/internships" title="Intern Queen Internship Listings"><strong>internships</strong></a>. Either put it back, or wear it down and straight. If you want to add some curl, that&rsquo;s fine—just don&rsquo;t go overboard. This isn&rsquo;t the runway!&rdquo; Berger says.</h3>
  <h2><br />
    <strong>Heavy Makeup</strong>  </h2>
  <h3><br />
    &ldquo;You want to look fresh and flawless,&rdquo; Berger says. &ldquo;Stick to basic&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/tips/one-minute-makeup-refreshes" title="One Minute Beauty Refreshers"><strong>makeup</strong></a>.&rdquo; Your internship is not the place to test-drive those crazy runway&nbsp;<a href="http://www.seventeen.com/beauty/tips/beauty-trends-try-now" title="The Hottest Beauty Trends To Try Now"><strong>makeup trends</strong></a>.Think foundation, powder, mascara, and light blush. A bright lip is OK if your office isn&rsquo;t too conservative, but be sure to keep the rest of your outfit and makeup extra simple.</h3>
  <h2><br />
    <strong>Outfits That Don't Fit The Office Culture</strong></h2>
  <h3><br />
    Once you spend a few days working, you&rsquo;ll get a feel for the unofficial &quot;dress code&quot; in the office. Take cues from the other women—if they always wear heels, you should too. Or if they never wear sleeveless tops without a cardigan, then you shouldn&rsquo;t either.&nbsp;It&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;possible to look cute&nbsp;<em>and </em>professional at your&nbsp;<a href="http://internqueen.com/" title="Intern Queen"><strong>internship</strong></a>, like&nbsp;<em>Seventeen</em>&nbsp;editor&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/devin_tomb" title="Devin Tomb Twitter"><strong>Devin</strong></a>. The cut of her dress is uber-professional (knee-length and no cleavage) but still brings the fun with it's bright color!</h3>

  <h2>Every intern needs:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Watch - A watch is great for keeping track of time and managing multple projects. </li>
    <li>Durable Tote Bag - Some internships require you to bring a laptop. A durable bag will make commutes a little less miserable. </li>
    <li>Cute Phone Case - No reason really but why not? </li>
    <li>Smartphone- When you are on the goyou can ask Siri for help. Maybe you need directions to the nearest Starbucks. </li>
