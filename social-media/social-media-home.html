  <p>There are rules for companies that are promotoint their products. But these tips can also appky to those looking for jobs or internships. You can promote yourself like a company promotes its products.  </p>
  <p>Before following your favorite cmpanies on Twitter and liking them on Facebook.. Try a digital detox. </p>
  <p>Scared to be social media-less or don&rsquo;t know where to begin? Take it slowly by trying one of these fun and easy ways to be social media-free, if only for an hour or two:</p>
  <p>1. Instead of scrolling through your twitter feed, flip through that book or magazine you&rsquo;ve been dying to read.<br />
    2. Take a 10-minute break to stretch and do breathing exercises.<br />
    3. Get your friends in on the unplugging by playing a game that requires the loser to buy dinner or drinks. How? Everyone stacks their phones in the center of the table. The first person to crack and reach for their phone loses!<br />
    4. Go for a quick run. You&rsquo;re Facebook friends will still be there when you return.<br />
    5. Have a face-to-face conversation with a friend or family member in which both of you agrees to silence your phones. Isn&rsquo;t it nice to have their full attention without the distracting tweets, texts, emails, updates, calls, snaps and scrolls? I think so.</p>
