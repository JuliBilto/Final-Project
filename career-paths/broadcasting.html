<h2>The Broadcast Journalism Career </h2>
<p><img src="../images/broadcasting-pic.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></p>
<p><strong>Broadcast Journalism</strong>Â is the field of news and journals which are &quot;broadcast&quot;, that is, published by electrical methods, instead of the older methods, such as printed newspapers and posters. Broadcast methods include radio (via air, cable, and Internet), television (via air, cable, and Internet), and, especially recently, the Internet generally. Such media disperse pictures (static and moving), visual text and/or sounds.</p>
<p>Scripts for speaking to be broadcast tend to be written differently from text to be read by the public. For instance, the former is generally less complex and more conversational. Radio and television are designed to be seen and heard sooner and more often than is a daily or weekly newspaper.</p>
