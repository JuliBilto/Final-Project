    <td><h3>About the Book</h3>
      <p>Simplified Chinese edition of Rework. Seth Godin, author of the international bestselling marketing Purple Cow that changed the way marketing is performed, says: &quot;Stop reading the review. Buy the book.&quot; This small book is filled with common sense - yes, you know them, but the book tells you how to put them into practice. In Simplified Chinese. Distributed by Tsai Fong Books, Inc.</p>
      <h3>About the Author </h3>
      <p>Jason Fried is the co-founder and President of 37signals, a privately-held Chicago-based company committed to building the best web-based tools possible with the least number of features necessary. 37signals' products include Basecamp, Highrise, Backpack, Campfire, Ta-da List, and Writeboard. 37signals also developed and open-sourced the Ruby on Rails programming framework. 37signals' products do less than the competition -- intentionally.</p>
      <h3>Reviews </h3>
      <p>Â &quot;Jason Fried and David Hansson follow their own advice in REWORK, laying bare the surprising philosophies at the core of 37signals' success and inspiring us to put them into practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;There's no jargon or filler here just hundreds of brilliantly simple rules for&nbsp;success.&nbsp; Part entrepreneurial handbook for the twenty-first century, part manifesto for anyone wondering how work really works in the modern age, REWORK isrequired&nbsp;reading for anyone tired of business platitudes.&quot;<br />
--Chris Anderson, New York Times bestselling author of THE LONG TAIL and FREE</p></td>
